# Spam Mail Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Spam Mail Prediction** project is a machine learning model designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam). It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and various machine learning algorithms to analyze the text content of emails and determine whether they are spam.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment used for experimentation.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training and evaluating models.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Library used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for exploring the dataset.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow.
- `dataset.csv` - Dataset containing labeled emails (spam/ham).
- `models/` - Folder (if applicable) to store trained machine learning models.

## 🔎 Data Preprocessing Steps
1. **Loading the dataset**: The dataset is read using Pandas.
2. **Text Cleaning**:
   - Removing special characters and punctuation.
   - Converting text to lowercase.
   - Removing stopwords.
   - Tokenizing and lemmatizing words using NLTK.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Converting text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4. **Splitting the dataset**:
   - Dividing data into training and testing sets.

## 🚀 Model Training & Evaluation
- Various machine learning models are trained, including:
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest Classifier**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Performance is evaluated using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results & Visualization
- Confusion matrices are plotted to analyze model performance.
- Feature importance analysis is conducted.
- Word cloud representations are generated to visualize frequently occurring words in spam and ham emails.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Download or load the dataset.
3. Open `Spam_Mail_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning techniques (LSTMs, Transformers) for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
- Integrate real-time email filtering using APIs.
